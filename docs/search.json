    "text": "Eric Green, PhD\nMaddie Metcalf, TA\nThis course will introduce you to research designs and methods in global health. Global health is a multi-disciplinary field, so we will consider approaches common to the behavioral and social sciences, public health, and medicine.\nOur primary interest will be the study of causal inference. In global health, we are often interested in knowing what treatments, programs, interventions, and policies “work” and why. To answer questions of impact, we often turn to randomized controlled trials, a mainstay of medical research. As such, we will spend time exploring the rationale, process, and limitations of experiments.\nRandomization is not always possible or advisable, however, and researchers must build a causal argument using non-experimental methods. We will review several approaches, consider relevant threats to causal inference, and discuss how to improve non-experimental research designs.\nAlong the way, we will cover research basics, such as asking evidence-based research questions, searching the literature, developing a theory of change, identifying indicators and collecting data, selecting research participants, and testing hypotheses. In the latter part of the course, we will turn to more specialized topics in global health research, such as writing research proposals and manuscripts, economic analyses, and making an impact."

As global health is the study and practice of improving health and achieving equity in health, global health research research includes all systematic efforts to create generalizable knowledge of how we can improve health and achieve equity in health for everyone, everywhere.\nGiven the complexity of our global health challenges, global health research is multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. This means that, as a budding global health researcher, you will likely collaborate on teams with colleagues from many different fields. Each discipline has its own methodological preferences and core approaches, but we all operate in the same research landscape that is divided into basic and applied research. Much of the literature in global health focuses on our applied challenges, so you will read a lot about clinical research and trials, translational research, implementation research, and M&E (monitoring and evaluation).\nSo no matter what discipline you call home, or what stage of research you find most interesting, you can make great contributions to our collective efforts to improve health and achieve equity in health.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUnderstand the definition of global health and what distinguishes global health from other related fields\nExplain what makes research scientific\nDescribe the landscape of global health research\nEnumerate the phases of clinical trials\nDescribe the key actors in the funding and production of global health research/initiatives\nList several scholarly journals that publish global health research\n\n\n\nPrepare\n\nRead Revised GHR Chapter 1 (use this specific link).\nRead “Fighting glioblastoma with recombinant poliovirus”\nThink about where your interests lie in the global health research landscape and be prepared to share with classmates.\nBrowse one or more of the journals that publish global health research and find at least one article that interests you.\n\n\n\nDuring Class\n\nDeck\nActivity\n\nIn this activity you will consider where your interests lie in the global health research landscape and identify academic journals that publish work related to these interests."

    "text": "1.4: Search the literature / Read scientific articles\nThroughout the process of identifying research problems, framing research questions, and designing your study, you’ll return over and over to the literature to ensure that your study is informed by prior work and is poised to contribute to your field. In this session you’ll learn strategies for searching the literature effectively and managing what you find.\nCritical appraisal is an important part of the scientific process. It’s what we do when asked to review a manuscript prior to publication, evaluate a grant proposal, read a new paper published in our field, and prepare a systematic review or meta-analysis. You might feel unprepared to provide critical feedback on someone else’s work until you know more about research methods, designs, and analysis, but it’s easy to get started if you use a framework like the reporting guidelines published by the Equator Network or some of the tools listed below in additional resources. When it’s time to communicate your feedback, be nice. Be critical, be honest about the flaws you perceive, but always be nice and assume that the authors did their best. If their best is not publishable and cannot be fixed with revision, then recommend that the paper be rejected or the grant not funded. It happens. Even in rejecting someone’s work you can offer ideas for improvement.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nConduct an effective literature search\nUnderstand options for accessing journal articles\nUse a reference manager\nUnderstand how to read and critique a systematic review\nInterpret a meta-analysis and forest plot\nCritically appraise scientific work\nOutline the anatomy of a scientific paper\nDeliver constructive feedback\n\n\n\nPrepare\n\nGreenhalgh, T.

    "text": "3.3-3.4: Quasi-experimental\nWhen randomization is not possible or ethical, we have to rely on nonrandomized studies for causal inference. There are two main types of nonrandomized studies: quasi-experimental and observational.

I probably made it less cool with my edits over time.\nDifference-in-difference analysis is one of the oldest tricks in the book. In the mid-1800s, John Snow used this method to discover how residents of London were being infected with cholera.\nSnow observed that the Southwark and Vauxhall Company and the Lambeth Company supplied water to high-death-rate districts in South London. Both companies used the Thames—which was highly contaminated—as their water source before 1852. In 1852, the Lambeth Company began to source water from the Thames Ditton river—which was upstream and uncontaminated. Snow was able to show that between 1849 and 1854, districts that remained supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Company saw an increase in deaths from cholera while those supplied by the Lambeth Company experienced a reduction in deaths from cholera.\nUse this table taken from Snow’s original 1855 article to reproduce Snow’s difference-in-difference estimates."
