## Getting Started

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

* Describe the landscape of global health research
* Begin developing research ideas
* Effectively search the literature and make use of systematic reviews and meta-analyses
* Critically appraise scientific work 

## 1.1: Global health research

Research is defined as a systematic investigation whose goal is to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. As global health is the study and practice of improving health and achieving equity in health, global health research research includes all systematic efforts to create generalizable knowledge of how we can improve health and achieve equity in health for everyone, everywhere.

Given the complexity of our global health challenges, global health research is multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. This means that, as a budding global health researcher, you will likely collaborate on teams with colleagues from many different fields. Each discipline has its own methodological preferences and core approaches, but we all operate in the same research landscape that is divided into basic and applied research. Much of the literature in global health focuses on our applied challenges, so you will read a lot about clinical research and trials, translational research, implementation research, and M&E (monitoring and evaluation).

So no matter what discipline you call home, or what stage of research you find most interesting, you can make great contributions to our collective efforts to improve health and achieve equity in health.

### Learning Objectives

* Understand the definition of global health and what distinguishes global health from other related fields
* Explain what makes research scientific
* Describe the landscape of global health research
* Enumerate the phases of clinical trials
* Describe the key actors in the funding and production of global health research/initiatives
* List several scholarly journals that publish global health research

### Prepare

* Read [Revised GHR Chapter 1 (use this specific link)](https://ericpgreen.github.io/ghr_ebook/ghr.html){target="_blank"}.
* Read ["Fighting glioblastoma with recombinant poliovirus"](https://medium.com/@ericpgreen/fighting-glioblastoma-with-recombinant-poliovirus-5bef1ebc7f41)
* Think about where your interests lie in the global health research landscape and be prepared to share with classmates.
* Browse one or more of the journals that publish global health research and find at least one article that interests you.

### During Class

In this activity you will consider where your interests lie in the global health research landscape and identify academic journals that publish work related to these interests.

If participating online, each group should make a copy of the [activity sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKT2ymNkiAd5ny8Cb6qMgOpU0nysRDn4pA9DR5tpQ20/edit?usp=sharing) and share it with themethodsection at gmail. Please name your file `GLHLTH-XXX-SN-SURNAME-SURNAME`, where "XXX" is the course number and SN" is the session number. 

## 1.2: Build collaborations, develop questions

Research ideas take time to develop. You can jumpstart the process by learning about interesting work. Attend talks, watch webinars, meet with mentors, talk with fellow students. Above all else, read the literature. When you are just starting out, try skimming widely read journals to get a sense of current developments in global health disciplines. Follow interesting leads by noting article keywords, inspecting reference lists, and seeking out clues authors leave you in the introduction and discussion.

Once you narrow your focus a bit, try searching scientific databases. If you wade into the open web, watch out for predatory journals masquerading as legitimate science (and hit delete on emails inviting you to publish your work, esteemed ladies and gentlemen).

And please, please use a reference manager to keep track of all the cool science you are reading.

### Learning Objectives

* Appreciate the process for developing research ideas and identifying potential research problems
* Conduct an effective literature search
* Understand options for accessing journal articles
* Use a reference manager

### Prepare

* Read [Revised GHR Chapter 2 (use this specific link)](https://ericpgreen.github.io/ghr_ebook/collaborations.html){target="_blank"}.
* Read [old GHR chapter on developing research ideas (use this specific link)](https://read.themethodsection.com/ideas.html){target="_blank"}.
